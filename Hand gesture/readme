This is a good set of instructions for detecting and sketching a hand :

www.intorobotics.com/9-opencv-tutorials-hand-gesture-detection-recognition/

This is what i have understood about the technique
1)Convert to gray scale
2)Blur the grayscale image
3)Threshold and find the contours
4)Find the largest contour which most likely is hand (Provided it is in the centre of the image)
“WE WILL GET A GOOD HAAR CASCADE FOR HAND”
5)Find the centre of the contour using moments method
6)Find the convex and concave regions and 
7)Draw around the the outer convex regions

The best way around the problem would be to treat the different hand gestures as nothing but somthing similar to 
handwritten digits .So similar to that  of the above algorithm we should be able to train the algo to learn to 
understand different hand gesture's .
