We are doing the following steps
1)Getting the image from the camera
2)Converting the image into GreyScale
3)Blurring the GreyScale Image
4)ThreshHolding on the Blurred image
5)Apply contour map to find the largest cotour region in the image (Most likely it will be the Hand )
6)Then apply the hull point detector (to find the convex and concave points)
7)Using simple logic , we can predit the hand gesture with accuracy of upto 65%
