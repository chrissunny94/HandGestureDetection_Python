This is a very usefull tool on OpenCv
1) Gets the images from the web cam
2) Stores the images in a queue
3) Finds the avg of the queue 
4) Subtracts the avg from the current CamFeed
5) This will give only the Dynamic objects in the frame

This could be later used in feature detection when it comes to HandGestures , Facial Expression reading , Tracking Dynamic Objects
